<h1>타입과 타입클래스</h1>
<a name="believe-the-type"></a>
<h2>타입을 믿으세요</h2>

<p>전에 하스켈은 정적 타입 시스템을 지녔다고 언급하였습니다. 모든 표현식의 타입은 컴파일 타임에 판명나며, 이는 보다 안전한
코드로 이끌어 줍니다. If you write a program where you try to divide a boolean
type with some number, it won't even compile. That's good because it's
better to catch such errors at compile time instead of having your
program crash. Everything in Haskell has a type, so the compiler can
reason quite a lot about your program before compiling it.</p>
<p>Unlike Java or Pascal, Haskell has type inference. If we write a
number, we don't have to tell Haskell it's a number. It can <i>infer</i>
that on its own, so we don't have to explicitly write out the types of
our functions and expressions to get things done. We covered some of
the basics of Haskell with only a very superficial glance at types.
However, understanding the type system is a very important part of
learning Haskell.</p>
<p>A type is a kind of label that every expression has. It tells us in
which category of things that expression fits. The expression <span
 class="fixed">True</span> is a boolean, <span class="fixed">"hello"</span>
is a string, etc.</p>
<p>Now we'll use GHCI to examine the types of some expressions. We'll
do that by using the <span class="fixed">:t</span> command which,
followed by any valid expression, tells us its type. Let's give it a
whirl.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; :t 'a'<br>'a' :: Char<br>ghci&gt; :t True<br>True :: Bool<br>ghci&gt; :t "HELLO!"<br>"HELLO!" :: [Char]<br>ghci&gt; :t (True, 'a')<br>(True, 'a') :: (Bool, Char)<br>ghci&gt; :t 4 == 5<br>4 == 5 :: Bool<br></pre>
<p>
<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/bomb.png" alt="bomb"
 class="right" height="144" width="171">Here we see that doing <span
 class="fixed">:t</span> on an expression prints out the expression
followed by <span class="fixed">::</span> and its type. <span
 class="fixed">::</span> is read as "has type of". Explicit types are
always denoted with the first letter in capital case. <span
 class="fixed">'a'</span>, as it would seem, has a type of <span
 class="fixed">Char</span>. It's not hard to conclude that it stands
for <i>character</i>. <span class="fixed">True</span> is of a <span
 class="fixed">Bool</span> type. That makes sense. But what's this?
Examining the type of <span class="fixed">"HELLO!"</span> yields a <span
 class="fixed">[Char]</span>. The square brackets denote a list. So we
read that as it being <i>a list of characters</i>. Unlike lists, each
tuple length has its own type. So the expression of <span class="fixed">(True,
'a')</span> has a type of <span class="fixed">(Bool, Char)</span>,
whereas an expression such as <span class="fixed">('a','b','c')</span>
would have the type of <span class="fixed">(Char, Char, Char)</span>. <span
 class="fixed">4 == 5</span> will always return <span class="fixed">False</span>,
so its type is <span class="fixed">Bool</span>.
</p>
<p>
Functions also have types. When writing our own functions, we can
choose to give them an explicit type declaration. This is generally
considered to be good practice except when writing very short
functions. From here on, we'll give all the functions that we make type
declarations. Remember the list comprehension we made previously that
filters a string so that only caps remain? Here's how it looks like
with a type declaration.
</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: hs">removeNonUppercase :: [Char] -&gt; [Char]<br>removeNonUppercase st = [ c | c &lt;- st, c `elem` ['A'..'Z']] <br></pre>
<p>
<span class="fixed">removeNonUppercase</span> has a type of <span
 class="fixed">[Char] -&gt; [Char]</span>, meaning that it maps from a
string to a string. That's because it takes one string as a parameter
and returns another as a result. The <span class="fixed">[Char]</span>
type is synonymous with <span class="fixed">String</span> so it's
clearer if we write <span class="fixed">removeNonUppercase :: String
-&gt; String</span>. We didn't have to give this function a type
declaration because the compiler can infer by itself that it's a
function from a string to a string but we did anyway. But how do we
write out the type of a function that takes several parameters? Here's
a simple function that takes three integers and adds them together:
</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: hs">addThree :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int<br>addThree x y z = x + y + z<br></pre>
<p>The parameters are separated with <span class="fixed">-&gt;</span>
and there's no special distinction between the parameters and the
return type. The return type is the last item in the declaration and
the parameters are the first three. Later on we'll see why they're all
just separated with <span class="fixed">-&gt;</span> instead of having
some more explicit distinction between the return types and the
parameters like <span class="fixed">Int, Int, Int -&gt; Int</span> or
something.
</p>
<p>If you want to give your function a type declaration but are unsure
as to what it should be, you can always just write the function without
it and then check it with <span class="fixed">:t</span>. Functions are
expressions too, so <span class="fixed">:t</span> works on them
without a problem.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of some common types.</p>
<p>
<span class="label type">Int</span> stands for integer. It's used for
whole numbers. <span class="fixed">7</span> can be an <span
 class="fixed">Int</span> but <span class="fixed">7.2</span> cannot. <span
 class="fixed">Int</span> is bounded, which means that it has a minimum
and a maximum value. Usually on 32-bit machines the maximum possible <span
 class="fixed">Int</span> is 2147483647 and the minimum is -2147483648.
</p>
<p><span class="label type">Integer</span> stands for, er &hellip; also
integer. The main difference is that it's not bounded so it can be used
to represent really really big numbers. I mean like really big. <span
 class="fixed">Int</span>, however, is more efficient.
</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: hs">factorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer<br>factorial n = product [1..n]<br></pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; factorial 50<br>30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000<br></pre>
<p><span class="label type">Float</span> is a real floating point with
single precision.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: hs">circumference :: Float -&gt; Float<br>circumference r = 2 * pi * r<br></pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; circumference 4.0<br>25.132742<br></pre>
<p><span class="label type">Double</span> is a real floating point with
double the precision!</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: hs">circumference' :: Double -&gt; Double<br>circumference' r = 2 * pi * r<br></pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; circumference' 4.0<br>25.132741228718345<br></pre>
<p>
<span class="label type">Bool</span> is a boolean type. It can have
only two values: <span class="fixed">True</span> and <span
 class="fixed">False</span>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="label type">Char</span> represents a character. It's
denoted by single quotes. A list of characters is a string.
</p>
<p>Tuples are types but they are dependent on their length as well as
the types of their components, so there is theoretically an infinite
number of tuple types, which is too many to cover in this tutorial.
Note that the empty tuple <span class="label type">()</span> is also a
type which can only have a single value: <span class="fixed">()</span></p>
<a name="type-variables"></a>
<h2>Type variables</h2>
<p>
What do you think is the type of the <span class="fixed">head</span>
function? Because <span class="fixed">head</span> takes a list of any
type and returns the first element, so what could it be? Let's check!
</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; :t head<br>head :: [a] -&gt; a<br></pre>
<p>
<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/box.png" alt="box" class="left"
 height="93" width="130">Hmmm! What is this <span class="fixed">a</span>?
Is it a type? Remember that we previously stated that types are written
in capital case, so it can't exactly be a type. Because it's not in
capital case it's actually a <em>type variable</em>. That means that <span
 class="fixed">a</span> can be of any type. This is much like generics
in other languages, only in Haskell it's much more powerful because it
allows us to easily write very general functions if they don't use any
specific behavior of the types in them. Functions that have type
variables are called <em>polymorphic functions</em>. The type
declaration of <span class="fixed">head</span> states that it takes a
list of any type and returns one element of that type.
</p>
<p>Although type variables can have names longer than one character, we
usually give them names of a, b, c, d &hellip;</p>
<p>Remember <span class="fixed">fst</span>? It returns the first
component of a pair. Let's examine its type.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; :t fst<br>fst :: (a, b) -&gt; a<br></pre>
<p>
We see that <span class="fixed">fst</span> takes a tuple which
contains two types and returns an element which is of the same type as
the pair's first component. That's why we can use <span class="fixed">fst</span>
on a pair that contains any two types. Note that just because <span
 class="fixed">a</span> and <span class="fixed">b</span> are different
type variables, they don't have to be different types. It just states
that the first component's type and the return value's type are the
same.
</p>
<a name="typeclasses-101"></a>
<h2>Typeclasses 101</h2>
<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/classes.png" alt="class"
 class="right" height="158" width="210">
<p>A typeclass is a sort of interface that defines some behavior. If a
type is a part of a typeclass, that means that it supports and
implements the behavior the typeclass describes. A lot of people coming
from OOP get confused by typeclasses because they think they are like
classes in object oriented languages. Well, they're not. You can think
of them kind of as Java interfaces, only better.
</p>
<p>What's the type signature of the <span class="fixed">==</span>
function?</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; :t (==)<br>(==) :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool<br></pre>
<div class="hintbox"><em>Note</em>: the equality operator, <span
 class="fixed">==</span> is a function. So are <span class="fixed">+</span>,
<span class="fixed">*</span>, <span class="fixed">-</span>, <span
 class="fixed">/</span> and pretty much all operators. If a function is
comprised only of special characters, it's considered an infix function
by default. If we want to examine its type, pass it to another function
or call it as a prefix function, we have to surround it in parentheses.</div>
<p>Interesting. We see a new thing here, the <span class="fixed">=&gt;</span>
symbol. Everything before the <span class="fixed">=&gt;</span> symbol
is called a <em>class constraint</em>. We can read the previous type
declaration like this: the equality function takes any two values that
are of the same type and returns a <span class="fixed">Bool</span>.
The type of those two values must be a member of the <span
 class="fixed">Eq</span> class (this was the class constraint).</p>
<p>The <span class="fixed">Eq</span> typeclass provides an interface
for testing for equality. Any type where it makes sense to test for
equality between two values of that type should be a member of the <span
 class="fixed">Eq</span> class. All standard Haskell types except for
IO (the type for dealing with input and output) and functions are a
part of the <span class="fixed">Eq</span> typeclass.</p>
<p>The <span class="fixed">elem</span> function has a type of <span
 class="fixed">(Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool</span> because it
uses <span class="fixed">==</span> over a list to check whether some
value we're looking for is in it.</p>
<p>Some basic typeclasses:</p>
<p><span class="label class">Eq</span> is used for types that support
equality testing. The functions its members implement are <span
 class="fixed">==</span> and <span class="fixed">/=</span>. So if
there's an <span class="fixed">Eq</span> class constraint for a type
variable in a function, it uses <span class="fixed">==</span> or <span
 class="fixed">/=</span> somewhere inside its definition. All the types
we mentioned previously except for functions are part of <span
 class="fixed">Eq</span>, so they can be tested for equality.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; 5 == 5<br>True<br>ghci&gt; 5 /= 5<br>False<br>ghci&gt; 'a' == 'a'<br>True<br>ghci&gt; "Ho Ho" == "Ho Ho"<br>True<br>ghci&gt; 3.432 == 3.432<br>True<br></pre>
<p>
<span class="label class">Ord</span> is for types that have an ordering.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; :t (&gt;)<br>(&gt;) :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool<br></pre>
<p>
All the types we covered so far except for functions are part of <span
 class="fixed">Ord</span>. <span class="fixed">Ord</span> covers all
the standard comparing functions such as <span class="fixed">&gt;</span>,
<span class="fixed">&lt;</span>, <span class="fixed">&gt;=</span> and <span
 class="fixed">&lt;=</span>. The <span class="fixed">compare</span>
function takes two <span class="fixed">Ord</span> members of the same
type and returns an ordering. <span class="label type">Ordering</span>
is a type that can be <span class="fixed">GT</span>, <span
 class="fixed">LT</span> or <span class="fixed">EQ</span>, meaning <i>greater
than</i>, <i>lesser than</i> and <i>equal</i>, respectively. </p>
<p>To be a member of <span class="fixed">Ord</span>, a type must first
have membership in the prestigious and exclusive <span class="fixed">Eq</span>
club.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; "Abrakadabra" &lt; "Zebra"<br>True<br>ghci&gt; "Abrakadabra" `compare` "Zebra"<br>LT<br>ghci&gt; 5 &gt;= 2<br>True<br>ghci&gt; 5 `compare` 3<br>GT<br></pre>
<p>Members of <span class="label class">Show</span> can be presented
as strings. All types covered so far except for functions are a part of
<span class="fixed">Show</span>. The most used function that deals with
the <span class="fixed">Show</span> typeclass is <span class="fixed">show</span>.
It takes a value whose type is a member of <span class="fixed">Show</span>
and presents it to us as a string.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; show 3<br>"3"<br>ghci&gt; show 5.334<br>"5.334"<br>ghci&gt; show True<br>"True"<br></pre>
<p><span class="label class">Read</span> is sort of the opposite
typeclass of <span class="fixed">Show</span>. The <span class="fixed">read</span>
function takes a string and returns a type which is a member of <span
 class="fixed">Read</span>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; read "True" || False<br>True<br>ghci&gt; read "8.2" + 3.8<br>12.0<br>ghci&gt; read "5" - 2<br>3<br>ghci&gt; read "[1,2,3,4]" ++ [3]<br>[1,2,3,4,3]<br></pre>
<p>So far so good. Again, all types covered so far are in this
typeclass. But what happens if we try to do just <span class="fixed">read
"4"</span>?</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; read "4"<br>&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:<br>    Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:<br>      `Read a' arising from a use of `read' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-7<br>    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)<br></pre>
<p>What GHCI is telling us here is that it doesn't know what we want in
return. Notice that in the previous uses of <span class="fixed">read</span>
we did something with the result afterwards. That way, GHCI could infer
what kind of result we wanted out of our <span class="fixed">read</span>.
If we used it as a boolean, it knew it had to return a <span
 class="fixed">Bool</span>. But now, it knows we want some type that is
part of the <span class="fixed">Read</span> class, it just doesn't
know which one. Let's take a look at the type signature of <span
 class="fixed">read</span>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; :t read<br>read :: (Read a) =&gt; String -&gt; a<br></pre>
<p>
See? It returns a type that's part of <span class="fixed">Read</span>
but if we don't try to use it in some way later, it has no way of
knowing which type. That's why we can use explicit <em>type annotations</em>.
Type annotations are a way of explicitly saying what the type of an
expression should be. We do that by adding <span class="fixed">::</span>
at the end of the expression and then specifying a type. Observe:
</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; read "5" :: Int<br>5<br>ghci&gt; read "5" :: Float<br>5.0<br>ghci&gt; (read "5" :: Float) * 4<br>20.0<br>ghci&gt; read "[1,2,3,4]" :: [Int]<br>[1,2,3,4]<br>ghci&gt; read "(3, 'a')" :: (Int, Char)<br>(3, 'a')<br></pre>
<p>Most expressions are such that the compiler can infer what their
type is by itself. But sometimes, the compiler doesn't know whether to
return a value of type <span class="fixed">Int</span> or <span
 class="fixed">Float</span> for an expression like <span class="fixed">read
"5"</span>. To see what the type is, Haskell would have to actually
evaluate <span class="fixed">read "5"</span>. But since Haskell is a
statically typed language, it has to know all the types before the code
is compiled (or in the case of GHCI, evaluated). So we have to tell
Haskell: "Hey, this expression should have this type, in case you don't
know!".</p>
<p><span class="label class">Enum</span> members are sequentially
ordered types &mdash; they can be enumerated. The main advantage of the
<span class="fixed">Enum</span> typeclass is that we can use its types
in list ranges. They also have defined successors and predecesors,
which you can get with the <span class="fixed">succ</span> and <span
 class="fixed">pred</span> functions. Types in this class: <span
 class="fixed">()</span>, <span class="fixed">Bool</span>, <span
 class="fixed">Char</span>, <span class="fixed">Ordering</span>, <span
 class="fixed">Int</span>, <span class="fixed">Integer</span>, <span
 class="fixed">Float</span> and <span class="fixed">Double</span>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; ['a'..'e']<br>"abcde"<br>ghci&gt; [LT .. GT]<br>[LT,EQ,GT]<br>ghci&gt; [3 .. 5]<br>[3,4,5]<br>ghci&gt; succ 'B'<br>'C'<br></pre>
<p><span class="label class">Bounded</span> members have an upper and a
lower bound.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; minBound :: Int<br>-2147483648<br>ghci&gt; maxBound :: Char<br>'\1114111'<br>ghci&gt; maxBound :: Bool<br>True<br>ghci&gt; minBound :: Bool<br>False<br></pre>
<p><span class="fixed">minBound</span> and <span class="fixed">maxBound</span>
are interesting because they have a type of <span class="fixed">(Bounded
a) =&gt; a</span>. In a sense they are polymorphic constants.</p>
<p>All tuples are also part of <span class="fixed">Bounded</span> if
the components are also in it.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; maxBound :: (Bool, Int, Char)<br>(True,2147483647,'\1114111')<br></pre>
<p><span class="label class">Num</span> is a numeric typeclass. Its
members have the property of being able to act like numbers. Let's
examine the type of a number.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; :t 20<br>20 :: (Num t) =&gt; t<br></pre>
<p>It appears that whole numbers are also polymorphic constants. They
can act like any type that's a member of the <span class="fixed">Num</span>
typeclass.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; 20 :: Int<br>20<br>ghci&gt; 20 :: Integer<br>20<br>ghci&gt; 20 :: Float<br>20.0<br>ghci&gt; 20 :: Double<br>20.0<br></pre>
<p>Those are types that are in the <span class="fixed">Num</span>
typeclass. If we examine the type of <span class="fixed">*</span>,
we'll see that it accepts all numbers.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell: ghci">ghci&gt; :t (*)<br>(*) :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a<br></pre>
<p>
It takes two numbers of the same type and returns a number of that
type. That's why <span class="fixed">(5 :: Int) * (6 :: Integer)</span>
will result in a type error whereas <span class="fixed">5 * (6 ::
Integer)</span> will work just fine and produce an <span class="fixed">Integer</span>
because <span class="fixed">5</span> can act like an <span
 class="fixed">Integer</span> or an <span class="fixed">Int</span>.
</p>
<p>To join <span class="fixed">Num</span>, a type must already be
friends with <span class="fixed">Show</span> and <span class="fixed">Eq</span>.</p>
<p><span class="class label">Integral</span> is also a numeric
typeclass. <span class="fixed">Num</span> includes all numbers,
including real numbers and integral numbers, <span class="fixed">Integral</span>
includes only integral (whole) numbers. In this typeclass are <span
 class="fixed">Int</span> and <span class="fixed">Integer</span>.</p>
<p><span class="class label">Floating</span> includes only floating
point numbers, so <span class="fixed">Float</span> and <span
 class="fixed">Double</span>.</p>
<p>A very useful function for dealing with numbers is <span
 class="label function">fromIntegral</span>. It has a type declaration
of <span class="fixed">fromIntegral :: (Num b, Integral a) =&gt; a
-&gt; b</span>. From its type signature we see that it takes an
integral number and turns it into a more general number. That's useful
when you want integral and floating point types to work together
nicely. For instance, the <span class="fixed">length</span> function
has a type declaration of <span class="fixed">length :: [a] -&gt; Int</span>
instead of having a more general type of <span class="fixed">(Num b)
=&gt; length :: [a] -&gt; b</span>. I think that's there for historical
reasons or something, although in my opinion, it's pretty stupid.
Anyway, if we try to get a length of a list and then add it to <span
 class="fixed">3.2</span>, we'll get an error because we tried to add
together an <span class="fixed">Int</span> and a floating point
number. So to get around this, we do <span class="fixed">fromIntegral
(length [1,2,3,4]) + 3.2</span> and it all works out.</p>
<p>Notice that <span class="fixed">fromIntegral</span> has several
class constraints in its type signature. That's completely valid and as
you can see, the class constraints are separated by commas inside the
parentheses.</p>
